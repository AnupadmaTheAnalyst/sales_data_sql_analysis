## 🚀 How to Run This Project

1. **Import the CSV file** (`sales_data_sample.csv`) into your SQL database (MySQL, SQLite, etc.).
2. Create a table named `sales_dataset`.
3. Open your SQL client (DBeaver, MySQL Workbench, etc.).
4. Execute the SQL files in this order:
   - `sales_performance_analysis.sql`
   - `customer_behavior_analysis.sql`
   - `operations_and_risk_analysis.sql`
5. Review the query results to see insights for each business question.
